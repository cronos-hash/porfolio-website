<h3>Introduction</h3>
My name is cronos-hash, I am 17 years old and extremely enjoy ICT not only that but I enjoy messing around with different aspects of ICT. 
Welcome to my Portfolio, from making this portfolio I am hoping to achieve a successful job application and to get recognised by some sort of company.
The main purpose of this portfolio is to showcase my ICT work to attract the attention of Konnekted and possibly other employers.
As you can probably already see here's some images of some work you will see in my portfolio.

<h3>Universal Access Security</h3>

<b>Graphic Designer</b>
<p>
When doing work experience as a graphic designer for a company called Universal Access Security (UAS)

I had many responsibilities, I needed to come up with a solution on how I can improve their website and logo. I had to manage a graphical design for the front of their bell boxes so people can see it from a distance so it can therefore increase their profits. While succeeding my responsibilities, my skills with image enhancing and manipulation software had grown including the speed I produce graphical designs and how carefully I go about doing the responsibility. I learnt many skills along with improving my ICT and drawing skills. I had also gained new skills and qualities, which are listed here:
<b><br>
Good spelling and grammar
<br>
An understanding of most recent trends and styles
<br>
The ability to manage my time and meet deadlines
<br>
Knowledge of printing techniques
<br>
An Ability to find practical solutions to problems</b></p>
