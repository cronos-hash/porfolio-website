<p><h3>Introduction</h3>
When learning about how to build my own personal computer I also learn't about digital video alongside.
 While learning how to plan for a computer build and how to build the computer itself I also learn't how to use camera equipment and how to edit videos on professional video editing software.
 I enjoyed building a computer and learning about digital video alongside together.
Here is an image of the inside of my computer which I put together.

<p>Before learning how to put the computer together I learn't about the components. I learnt what they do inside the personal computer,
 how they functioned, then I learn't how to fit them. 
 After learning where the components go and how they are fitted I learnt many things too with digital video such as, what shots they use when making videos. 
 For example in a football report they would use a long shot because the audience would want to see the whole pitch.
 This is so the audience knows what to expect. Here's an image of the graphics card inside my computer which I fitted.</p>

When viewing my work you will see a mixture of both my digital video work and building personal computer. This includes the images of the computer I was making changes on and the digital video design work, you will see things I learn't in digital video and the work I carried out in building a personal computer. You will see my equipment list, a lot of images which show different components in a computer and my justifications along with additional things that I did when doing digital video.

<div id="content_ex"><p>
The video content I used for my video page consists of different images and written documents all combined into one document below. I also have screenshots of the PC that I built, along with my test plan. I included information about costs of different components and how much it might be to put a low spec computer together. You will see that I wrote down what the requirements are. I also included health and safety precautions that I made when planning to build my PC you will then see the tests I did to make sure that the PC was working properly. You will see me actually put the PC together. You will also see me test the performance of the computer with performance testing software. You will see my explanation of a processor and what it does, my alternative designs and a document on how I implemented my alternative components into the pc along with my install sequence. you will see my justification on the components I used and a explanation of what refinements I might of made.

<div id="use_content2"><p>
  I included images of the computer because it can be used as evidence that I can install components correctly so I'm more likely to get employed by an employer. I included written documents of building a personal computer because they describe what order I fitted the components, how I fitted the components and what steps I needed to take first along with precautions I needed to make. All these skills shown will help me more to get employed in some sort of ICT industry since its shows that i have many skills especially when building a PC. I included a test plan to show that I can fix errors or faults that might occur so employers know that work effectively to insure that it meets a good standard. I chose to include my explanation of a processor to show the employers that I have a good understanding of how the processor works and functions.
