<h3>Introduction</h3>
In this unit I learn't many things but mainly how to program in C++ and make my own software such as a currency calculator. I made programs which require passwords and alot more. Additionally, these weren't the only things I learn't. I also learn't how to draw and plan programs in flowcharts and to use a I/O table to work out what processes I will use to do different functions.
I use Microsoft Visual Studio to do most of my programming.

<p>Before learning how to program with C++ properly, I fell into many traps but in the end I finally got my head around how everything works. I made test programs such as this Quiz Calculator. I learnt many structures such as the If statement, the exception structure and many more. Now that I've learn't C++ and how to make programs using visual basics I plan to use this possibly in a future job but there are still many options in ICT for me such as becoming a graphic designer or a web developer.</p>

When viewing my work you will see that I've included most of my programming work. This includes some of the things I did when learning about C++ and doing programming. You will see the things I learn't in programming and the work I carried out and completed. You will see my program code, my program design and my programs test plan along with additional things that I did when doing programming. You will also see how I used flowcharts to plan my program and how I stopped errors.

<div id="content_ex"><p>
The content I used for my content page is written documents of my programming work along with additional examples involving the flowcharts and my program code. You will see my review on my review you will see purposes of two applications and the characteristics of the language I used, along with listed techniques. From the fourth page, you will see more of my review with a flowchart to show how I think the program might process and make decisions.  On the fifth page you will my program code for a currency calculator that I made and then screenshots of the program actually working. You will see my program design, this is where you will see all the flowcharts I made for my program along with my alternative and original designs. You will see my test plan which I used to test my program. you will also see how I refined the quality of the program using the test results.

<p>
I chose to include written documents of my programming work because it demonstrates that I have a good-sense of the programming language, I can suggest improvements where needed and I can find the strengths and weaknesses in a program, which could all be valuable skills needed for some ICT jobs. I included my program code on the content page because it demonstrates that I know fundamental skills in programming and that I can use the programming language of C++, which might be needed for some potential employers. I included screenshots of my program working to show the employers that I can successfully get a program up and running to a good standard. I included my review to show skills that might be needed in a programming job. I chose my test plan , my alternative designs and original designs to show that I can design the program before-hand and test it afterwards for any faults to make sure that its to a good standard.
