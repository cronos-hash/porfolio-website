<h3>Introduction</h3>
I will be showcasing some of my work from both unit 1, the online world and unit 2, technology systems.
 In unit 1, I learnt many things such as how and why online services can be used,
 the features of online advertising, the affiliate model of pay-per-click,
 how online communication can be used and the implications of online communication.
 I completed different activity sheets to help myself learn.

<p>Even though revising for exams doesn't sound very interesting I learn't many things, I learn't a lot about the inside of ICT. I learnt the concepts, functions and impact of the worldwide web, processes of digital data and analogue. In unit 2, I also learnt many things. I learnt about hierarchical structure of a computer (and its software), characteristics of high-level programming languages and low-level programming languages.</p>

<div id="content_ex_exam"><p>
The content I used for my exam page consists of different activities and revision notes all combined into one document I also have additional work such as a mind map of an application called Viber. I included activity 2, I faced 2 questions on this sheet both asking me why I chose the advertisements for the website design they supplied. I had to design my own web banner and show where Id put the adverts on the website. You will see my Activity 3 worksheet which I included, it shows different online services such as communication and commerce I had to describe the benefits and give examples of where they can be used. You will also see a questionnaire I did to test me of my knowledge of cloud computing. I had to write the advantages and disadvantages of cloud computing and also answer additional questions such as what RFID stands for. You will then see examples of online advertisement which I found on a popular website along with that you will also see questions I filled in when working in class. You will also see a Viber mind map which I made in group which shows all the features of an application called Viber. On page 12 onwards you will see all my revision notes which I did at home when revising for exams. Theres many questions that I asked myself before I went into the exam to test myself. I got a friend to ask me the questions to help me.

<div id="use_content">
<p>
I chose to include my activity sheets on my exam content page because company's will know that I'm a reliable worker due to the quantity and quality of my work. I also chose to include this content on my content page because it demonstrates my knowledge of The Online World
 and also shows that I've worked hard towards my studies. It also shows a range of my work in The Online World unit. On my exam content page I also included my revision notes and my questionnaire, which I created to help myself for the upcoming exams. I chose to include this because company's or employers will see that I can well prepare myself for different situations and work towards a grade effectively .
