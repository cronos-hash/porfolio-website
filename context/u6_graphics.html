<h3>Introduction</h3>
When I was learning about graphics, I learnt how to use certain programs which are used for editing images such as Adobe Fireworks and Adobe Photoshop. I was also learning the differences between bitmap and vector and how to produce my own chocolate bar wrapper along with a collection box used to store money.
This image is a picture of the chocolate bar I created. I made the images using Adobe Photoshop and my ready-made assets.

<p>I enjoyed making my own images and displaying them on a product for everyone to see. I also enjoyed how challenging some of the tasks were when learning about graphics. I developed many skills I didn't know I had in graphics including using image editing software. Even though at the end of this unit I used all of my printing credit, I successfully met the target I wanted and was happy with my results.
Here's an image of the collection box I made in graphics.

When viewing my work you will see all my Digital Graphics work. This includes the images of my collection box which I made alone with my chocolate bar wrapper I made, you will see how I used different image editing software and the justifications I made when refining my work. You will see what assets and images I used, the designs I made along with additional things that I included.

<div id="content_ex_graphics"><p>
The graphics content I used for my graphics page consists of different images and written documents all combined into one document below. I also have screenshots of some logo designs that I considered using for my chocolate bar wrapper. I included my research document on two graphical products. I had to create a document which explained the intended audience of two graphical products and then had to review how the product was fit for purpose and there intended effect on the audience. I included some additional information such as the strengths and weaknesses of the two graphical products. You will see my design ideas for my graphical product which I had to make. I described the audience and purpose of the graphic products which I was about to design. I wrote about the user requirements of the guide and requirements for the chocolate bar wrapper. Both the chocolate bar wrapper and the friendly guide for children were the products that I had to make included my sources table. On my sources table I showed where I got my ready-made assets from. You will see the mistakes I made when making my collection box and chocolate wrapper, I made many improvements to fix these. You will see a lot of my written work along with my test plan, my designs and examples of how I refined my assets

<div id="use_content3"><p>
I chose to include images of both the chocolate wrapper and the collection box since it shows that I created my own graphical products to a good standard,
  employers might need someone who can create digital graphics for there product or company, which is why I included this content. I included most of my written documents because it demonstrates that I have good knowledge about Digital graphic products and shows that I can identify improvements, make my own designs, come up with a range of ideas, refine assets and create my own graphic work using Photoshop.
I chose to include screen shots of my logo designs since employers might find some of my designs interesting,
 I also chose to have my research documents on the content page to show that I can collect a variety of information to help myself and make decisions based on the layout and designs I have. I chose to include my test plan, justification and my sources table to show the employers that I can make improvements, collect the right information and prove that my designs meet the purpose.</p>
